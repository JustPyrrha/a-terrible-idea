# a terrible idea
this is a terrible idea in which i create the exact same discord bot for every library listed on the discord community libs table.

## layout
```
root
 ├╴lang1
 │  ├╴lib1
 │  └╴lib2
 └╴lang2
    ├╴lib3
    └╴lib4
```

## the bot
the bot is a basic slash command bot with two commands.\
the first command is the standard `/ping` command.\
and the second is a user-info command displaying information about a user in an embed.\
for libraries that dont currently support slash commands I'll just use regular chat commands with a slash prefix.\
